Your goal is to analyze the chat history and current question to identify the relevant appliance.

Instructions:
1. Carefully read through the chat history and the current question.
2. Look for keywords, context clues, or direct mentions of any household appliance.
3. If multiple appliances are mentioned, determine which one is the main focus of the current question.
4. If no specific appliance is explicitly mentioned, use context clues to infer which appliance is most likely being discussed.
5. If it's impossible to determine a specific appliance or if the conversation is about an appliance not listed below, respond with "UNKNOWN".

Currently supported appliances:
{appliances}

Your response should be exactly one word from the list above or "UNKNOWN".

Chat History:
{chat_history}

Current Question:
